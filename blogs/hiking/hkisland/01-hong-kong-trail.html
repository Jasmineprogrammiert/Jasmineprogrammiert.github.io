      <p>The desire to do Hong Kong Trail in one go came very strongly after the challenge of "劏青蛙" ----- a 20-ish km hiking trail across HK Island from the western to the eastern point, which was the longest hike I have ever done at that time.</p>
      <p>After carefully looking through HK Trail at the map, I decided to have a try. The most difficult one among all sections is the Jardine's Lookout, with an elevation of more than 400m, which I have done many times and reckon it a relatively easy one. Ironically, it drained me inside out this time.</p>
      <p>The starting point is outside of the Peak Galleria. Since we had breakfast at Kennedy Town, we decided to hike up to The Peak via The University of Hong Kong (HKU), which led us strightly to distance post H005.</p>

      <p>The first two sections were very easy, with mostly flat concrete trails. Even though the temperature rose as the sun came out, it was not very hot. Since the trees and streams along cooled the air down. We reached Peel Rise within two hours, felt pretty energetic and were ready to take on Stage 3.</p>

      <p>Stage. 3 was very pleasing to trek on, with many streams and old bridges where one could take a pause and chill out. It was also possible to go under the bridges and play around along the streams. Although it was around the Aberdeen Reservoir, it was not visible until one reach Stage 4. In my opinion, this was the most tedious part of the entire journey.</p>

      <p>With seemingly endless concrete paths and slopes, and the company of strong sunshine, we finally reached the start of Sec. 5 at 3pm, 6.5 hr after departing from HKU. We took a long break at the Wong Chung Reservoir before heading to Jardine's Lookout, where people have to climb up and down a few times via the everlasting stairs. I must say the sky was pretty beautiful at that time, there was visible cloud sea from the landscape. Unfortunately, I was too worn out to enjoy. Every fiber of my body was focusing on lifting myself up and moving forward.</p>

      <p>Stage 6 and 7 were pretty easy ----- they were just dreadfully long. Especially the catchwater at Sec. 7, we walked fairly fast and it still took us almost 1.5hr to reach the end. Honestly, I did not feel very good at the end of Stage. 7. My soles hurt a lot, I was pretty fatigued and hungry. The thought of another 7.2km to go seems scary and withdrawing. "But you are already here, and there is only one stage left! Come on, you can do it!" I told myself so. After sharing our last food, we headed to Dragon's Back. It was called as one of Asia's most astonishing trails. I do agree that the view is beautiful there, but "one of Asia's most astonishing trails"?? Pardon, I do not second that at all!</p>

      <p>It took us 40min to hike up to Shek O Peak, which was the summit of Dragon's Back, then another 1.5hr to reach Big Wave Bay, by which my only thought was to find a place to sit and rest. Again, there was a reasonably long concrete road between Dragon's Back and Big Wave Bay. I have been there several times and I do not particularly enjoy it. I just dislike walking on the stiff concrete while hiking.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, we met another two guys who challenged trekking HK Trail all at once as we did while waiting at the bus stop. I did not expect that haha. Was it a coincidence or is it a popular dare nowadays? I will leave that for you to judge ;p</p>
