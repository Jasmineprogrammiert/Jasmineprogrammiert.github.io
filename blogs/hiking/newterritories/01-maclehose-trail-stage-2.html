      <p>The MacLehose Trail Stage 2 will probably always be one of my favorite and most memorable hikes. I can clearly remember coming across its info during the 2018 Chinese New Year and feeling compelled to do it. A little background of the 2018 Jasmine: an amateur jogger with no hiking experience and not familiar with Hong Kong beyond shopping districts. Oh, along with being underage. This is not to say I acted without caution: I planned my route, wore proper sports outfit, took sufficient water and food and constantly updated a trustworthy friend about my whereabouts.</p>
      <p>The scene of that day is still vivid in my mind. I grabbed a texi besides the Sai Kung Bus Terminus, got amazed by the view of MacLehose Trail Stage 1, and began hiking at roughly 2pm. Everything was new and interesting for me: the distance post, the trail runner, the view of a range of mountains with visible trails, the cows ...</p>

      <p>Unlike the picture below, it was very foggy when I first came there in 2018, so one could not see far away. However, the view of Long Ke Wan was still pretty impressive. If you look closely, you will see that the kind of trails varies quite a lot throughout the whole hike, which is an important reason why I like this trail so much.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Personally, I think Img 9 shows the best part of Sai Kung. The further you go, the less people there are at the beach, and the cleaner the seashore. It also reminds me of the mountaines in traditional Chinese paintings, where the mountaines always appear so light but with such a clear edge, and it was then that I realized why.</p>

      <p>Coincidentally, I took two pictures from the same angle over a span of 3 years. Please note that I did not filter the pic on right! The colour of the reservoir was that bluish in reality. The reservoir is fairly large, with approx 273 million cubic metres, and it is possible to view it from different trails. In my opinion, Kam Kui Shek Teng offers one of the best views, which I will touch on in future blog. Interestingly enough, the origin of this reservoir was like the reverse version of the 2019 political event in HK. History does repeat, doesn't it?</p>

      <p>With only a 30min walk from Chui Tung Au to Sai Wan Beach, Sai Wan becomes an ideal camping site for those who like a short, relaxing hike. There is a little village beside the beach where people can rent watersport equipments, dine in and buy supplements.</p>
      <p>The government newly built a stargazing site in 2019 with HK$2.3m. If I were camping, I would prefer to gaze at the stars from the comfort of my tent, since this facility is not that close to the campsite.</p>

      <p>Ham Tin Wan is only 30min away from Sai Wan, but it is much less busy and has a much cleaner beach. I would walk the extra mile to camp here if I ever get the chance. Img 15 shows Tung Wan Shan and Sharp Peak, two amazing peaks with their own charms. The "flat" part on right is Cheung Tsui, where I had an incredible first time camping experience :D</p>

      <p>There is a crossroad in the middle of Ham Tin Wan and Shek Keng, which is a relatively easy entryway to Shark Peak. It is usually quite busy during weekends. I once encountered a "traffic jam" ascending from there.</p>

      <p>Chek Keng is another option for camping at Sai Kung, it is fairly easy to access too --- there are ferries to Wong Shek Pier and other desinations. Additionally, there is a youth hotel called Bradbury Hall near the pier.</p>

      <p>Whenever I have to go through abandoned villages alone, I always run rather than hike. Especially when it is getting dark.</p>

      <p>The most important thing after a hike is ... to get my stomach full again XD. I usually dine at Sai Kung before heading back. Or buy an ice cream at Mister Softee while waiting in line for the (mini)bus. Unfortunately, with Covid, it is not allowed to dine in after 6pm, not to mention eating at a crowded place...</p>
